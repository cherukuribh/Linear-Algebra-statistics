 Question 2:
(2) The trace of a square matrix is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right). 
Use a large number of randomly generated 2 × 2 matrices (with elements between −10 and 10) to investigate the following:

Code:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
for i in range(1,10000):
    M = np.random.randint(-10, 11, (2, 2))
#a)   
    M_t = M.trace() # trace of a matrix, sum of diagonal elements
    M_det = np.linalg.det(M)
    V, P = np.linalg.eig(M)
    sum_eVal = V[0]+V[1]
    np.isclose(sum_eVal,M_t)
    prod_eVal = V[0]*V[1]
    np.isclose(prod_eVal,M_det)
#b)
    matrix = M
    matrix_t = matrix.T
    symmetric_matrix = matrix + matrix_t - np.diag(matrix.diagonal())
    SV, SP = np.linalg.eig(symmetric_matrix)
    np.isreal(SV)
    np.isreal(SP)
#c)
    A = M
    t = A.trace()
    d = np.linalg.det(A)
    A2 = A@A
    tA = t*A
    dI = d*np.eye(2)
    result = A2-tA+dI
# result is a zero matrix
(a) How the eigenvalues of a matrix are related to its trace and determinant. 
The sum of eigenvalues equal to its trace of the matrix and the product of eigen values equal to its determinent of the matrix

(b) Whether the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are real or complex numbers. 
Eigen values of a symmetric matrix are real number.
(c) For matrix 𝐴 what is the value of 𝐴 2 − 𝑡𝐴 + 𝑑𝐼 where 𝑡 is the trace of 𝐴, 𝑑 is the determinant of 𝐴, and 𝐼 is the identity matrix.
Result is a zero matrix.
